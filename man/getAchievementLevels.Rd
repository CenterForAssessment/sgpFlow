\title{Categorize Scale Scores into Achievement Levels}
\usage{
getAchievementLevels(scale_score, cuts, labels)
}
\arguments{
\item{scale_score}{A numeric vector of scale scores to be categorized}

\item{cuts}{A numeric vector of cut scores that define the boundaries between achievement levels}

\item{labels}{A character vector of achievement level labels. Must be one element longer than cuts}
}
\value{
A character vector with the same length as scale_score, containing achievement level labels
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of scale scores and categorizes them into achievement levels
based on provided cut scores and corresponding labels.
}
\details{
The function uses R's \code{.bincode()} function to categorize scale scores into achievement levels.
The number of labels must be exactly one more than the number of cut scores, as each interval
between cuts (including -Inf to first cut and last cut to Inf) requires a label.
}
\examples{
# Example with 3 achievement levels
scale_scores <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
cut_scores <- c(200, 400)
level_labels <- c("Below Basic", "Basic", "Proficient")
getAchievementLevels(scale_scores, cut_scores, level_labels)

# Example with 4 achievement levels
cut_scores <- c(200, 300, 400)
level_labels <- c("Below Basic", "Basic", "Proficient", "Advanced")
getAchievementLevels(scale_scores, cut_scores, level_labels)
}
