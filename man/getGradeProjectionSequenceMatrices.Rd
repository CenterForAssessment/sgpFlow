\title{Generate Grade Projection Sequence Matrices}
\usage{
getGradeProjectionSequenceMatrices(sgpFlow.config, projection.splineMatrices)
}
\arguments{
\item{sgpFlow.config}{A list containing configuration settings including:
\itemize{
  \item grade.progression: Vector of grade levels
  \item grade.projection.sequence: Vector of projection sequence grades
  \item year_lags.progression: Vector of year lags for progression
  \item year_lags.projection.sequence: Vector of year lags for projection sequence
  \item content_area.progression: Vector of content areas for progression
  \item content_area.projection.sequence: Vector of content areas for projection sequence
  \item max.order.for.progression: Maximum order for progression
}}

\item{projection.splineMatrices}{A list containing spline matrices used for projections}
}
\value{
A list of matrices, with highest orders first, where each element represents
  a combination of grade progression and projection sequence.
}
\description{
Creates a sequence of matrices for grade projections based on configuration settings.
This is an internal function used to generate the necessary matrices for SGP projections.

This function is not exported and is intended for internal use only.
