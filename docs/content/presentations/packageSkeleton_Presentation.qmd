<h2>Inspiration</h2>

- Kentucky's accountability system re-design decision to forgo growth and utilize improvement instead.
- Countless discussions at TAC meetings where accountability system terminology is used interchangeably and incorrectly (most notably by experts in our field).
- Numerous presentations at TAC meetings of poorly designed quasi-experimental studies using results from state summative assessments.
- Characterizations of "learning loss" and "recovery" during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Numerous staff meeting discussions about accountability systems and their design.
- 2023 Brian Gong Colloquium on accountability system design.

<h2>Coherence</h2>

- The term [__coherence__]{style="color: magenta;"} is not frequently used in discussions of accountability systems and when it is, it is often not clearly defined.
- What is coherence with respect to accountability systems?
- What is incoherent about current accountability systems?
- Why is coherence important?
- How can coherence be instantiated in accountability systems?

<h2>Gill's Framework</h2>

- Brian Gill's [-@Gill:2022] paper, _What should the future of educational accountability look like?,_ introduces a useful framework for indicators used in accountability systems.
- Three Core Components of Gill's Framework
  - **Processes:**  The activities, instructional practices, and organizational elements that schools implement to support student learning.
  - **Impacts:**  The measurable effects of processes on student learning and development, often captured through growth metrics or value-added models.
  - **Outcomes:**  The long-term results of education, such as achievement/proficiency levels, graduation rates, and other indicators of student success.

- Gill argues that for indicators to drive meaningful improvement, they must be:
  - **Valid:** Accurately measure what they claim to measure without systematic bias.
  - **Reliable:** Stable and consistent over time to avoid misdiagnosis or loss of credibility.
  - **Robust:** Resistant to unintended consequences and manipulation while capturing critical dimensions of educational quality.

## Requirements

- **R**: The latest version of R (available from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))
- **Quarto**: The Quarto CLI tool for building documents and websites ([Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)).
- **Git**: Version control to manage your code and push to GitHub.
- **GitHub**: Host your R package and website.

---

## GitHub Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the `packageSkeleton` repo from GitHub.
2. **Clone Locally**: Clone the repo to your local machine using Git.
3. **Push Changes**: After making your edits, push them to your GitHub repository.
4. **Deploy Website**: Use GitHub Pages to host the Quarto-based documentation.

---

## Customizing the Website

- **Quarto Configuration**: Customize the `_quarto.yml` file to change the website settings such as title, author, and repository URL.
- **Add Pages**: Create `.qmd` files to add custom documentation, tutorials, and more.
- **Themes & Layouts**: Modify the website’s theme using CSS or choose from Quarto’s built-in themes.

---

## Building Your Package

- **Add Functions**: Use the `R/` folder to store your custom R scripts and functions.
- **Generate Documentation**: Write roxygen-style documentation for each function and build it using `devtools::document()`.
- **Check Your Package**: Ensure your package passes all R CMD checks by running `devtools::check()`.

---

## Publishing the Website

1. **Build the Website**: Run `quarto render` to build the static HTML content.
2. **Publish on GitHub Pages**: Push your changes to the repository and GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the site.
3. **Preview Locally**: Use `quarto preview` to see live updates of the website as you edit.

---

## Conclusion

- **packageSkeleton** is a powerful starting point for R package development.
- Use it to streamline your workflow, create well-documented R code, and publish it with a professional Quarto-powered website.
- Leverage GitHub for collaboration, version control, and public distribution of your work.
