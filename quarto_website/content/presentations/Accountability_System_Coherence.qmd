<h2>Inspiration</h2>

- Kentucky's accountability system re-design decision to forgo growth and utilize improvement instead.
- Countless discussions at TAC meetings where accountability system terminology is used interchangeably and incorrectly (most notably by experts in our field).
- Numerous presentations at TAC meetings discussing poorly designed quasi-experimental studies using results from state summative assessments.
- Characterizations of "learning loss" and "recovery" during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Numerous staff meeting discussions about accountability systems and their design.
- 2023 Brian Gong Colloquium on accountability system design.

<h2>Coherence</h2>

- The term [__coherence__]{style="color: magenta;"} is not frequently used in discussions of accountability systems and when it is, it is often not clearly defined.
- What is coherence with respect to accountability systems?
- What is incoherent about current accountability systems?
- Why is coherence important?
- How can coherence be instantiated in accountability systems?

<h2>Gill's Framework</h2>

- Brian Gill's [-@Gill:2022] paper, _What should the future of educational accountability look like?,_ introduces a useful framework for indicators used in accountability systems.
- Three Core Components of Gill's Framework
  - **Processes:**  The activities, instructional practices, and organizational elements that schools implement to support student learning.
  - **Impacts:**  The measurable effects of processes on student learning and development, often captured through growth metrics or value-added models.
  - **Outcomes:**  The long-term results of education, such as achievement/proficiency levels, graduation rates, and other indicators of student success.

- Gill argues that for indicators to drive meaningful improvement, they must be:
  - **Valid:** Accurately measure what they claim to measure without systematic bias.
  - **Reliable:** Stable and consistent over time to avoid misdiagnosis or loss of credibility.
  - **Robust:** Resistant to unintended consequences and manipulation while capturing critical dimensions of educational quality.
